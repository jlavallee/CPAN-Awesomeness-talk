          * The first time you run cpan, it will prompt for a lot of information
          
          * Hopefully most of it is pretty self-explanitory
            * don't worry if you're missing some of the programs it's looking for
            * generally cpan will work file without them (I.E. ncftpget)
          
          * In general, the defaults should be fine
          
          * My recommendations:
          
          
            * auto commit config changes
          
            * Always commit changes to config variables to disk? [no] yes
