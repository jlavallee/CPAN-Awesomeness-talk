                                     CPAN::Mini to the rescue!
          
          * What is CPAN::Mini?
            * creates a minimal mirror of CPAN
          
            * only the files needed to install the newest version of every CPAN distribution: 
          
            * index files:
              *   01mailrc.txt.gz
              *   02packages.details.txt.gz
              *   03modlist.data.gz
          
            * module files:
              *   the last non-developer release of every dist for every author
          
            * that must be huge!
            * it's not *that* big - mine is currently 1.1G
