          * Turnkey CPAN Testers smoking
          
            * No configuration needed
          
            * Tests each distribution as a separate CPAN process -- each
             distribution has prerequisites like build_requires satisfied from
             scratch
          
            * Automatically checks for new distributions every twelve hours or as
             otherwise specified
          
            * Continues until interrupted with CTRL-C
