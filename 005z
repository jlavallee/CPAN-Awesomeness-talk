          * My recommendations:
          
            * auto commit config changes
          
              Always commit changes to config variables to disk? [no] yes
          
            * follow prerequisits
          
              Policy on building prerequisites (follow, ask or ignore)? [ask] follow
          
            * install build_requires: yes (or no, but not ask!)
          
              Policy on installing 'build_requires' modules (yes, no, ask/yes, ask/no)? [ask/yes] yes
          
            * Module::Build as prefered installer 
          
              In case you can choose between running a Makefile.PL or a Build.PL,
          which installer would you prefer (EUMM or MB or RAND)? [MB]
