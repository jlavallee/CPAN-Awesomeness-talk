          * The first time you run cpan, it will prompt for a lot of information
          
          * Hopefully most of it is pretty self-explanitory
            * don't worry if you're missing some of the programs it's looking for
            * generally cpan will work file without them (I.E. ncftpget)
          
          * In general, the defaults should be fine
          
          * My recommendations:
          
          
            * auto commit config changes
          
            * Always commit changes to config variables to disk? [no] yes
          
            * follow prerequisits
          
            * Policy on building prerequisites (follow, ask or ignore)? [ask] follow
          
            * install build_requires: yes (or no, but not ask!)
          
            * Policy on installing 'build_requires' modules (yes, no, ask/yes, ask/no)? [ask/yes] yes
